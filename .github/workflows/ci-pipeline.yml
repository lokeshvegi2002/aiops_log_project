# This is our CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline
name: CI Pipeline

# 1. This controls WHEN the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Also allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# 2. This defines WHAT the workflow does
jobs:
  # We're defining a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of machine to run the job on (GitHub-hosted Ubuntu)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository code
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Sets up a Python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10' # We can specify the version

      # Step 3: Installs our dependencies (Flask)
      # We'll also add a requirements.txt file for this next
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install Flask
          
      # Step 4: A simple test to see if the app runs
      # It runs the app in the background, waits 5 secs, and checks if it's still running
      - name: Test if app runs
        run: |
          python3 app.py &
          sleep 5
          # Check if the process is still running
          pgrep -f "python3 app.py" || (echo "App failed to start" && exit 1)
